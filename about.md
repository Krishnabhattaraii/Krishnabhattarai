"Personal Finance Dashboard"

This project will help you track your income,
expenses, savings, and investments. It will
involve data visualization, budget tracking, 
and financial forecasting using flask and python.......

1) first of all
create a virtual environment and install Flask using the following commands:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_bcrypt flask_login


2) create the flask app
directory structure:
finance_dashboard/
├── app.py
├── models.py
├── forms.py
├── routes.py
├── templates/
│   ├── layout.html
│   ├── login.html
│   ├── register.html
│   ├── dashboard.html
└── static/
    └── styles.css


This basic structure sets up user authentication,
and basic forms for adding income and expenses.

3) Run the app as:
flask run
Now you can access the dashboard and start adding features as needed.
